                <h6>Reader reviews from Amazon:</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>While this book is dated, most of the concepts discussed still apply to the financial industry today. A recommended read for anyone looking to gain more insight into the stock market.</li>
                  <li>A brief but insanely great read, Adam Smith made me laugh out loud at least half a dozen times with his dry sarcasm and sardonic wit....Written almost a decade before I was born, the book is just as relevant today as it was in the latter half of the sixties.</li>
                  <li>Like others, I first read this book many years ago. I was wondering if I'd still find it as enjoyable and relevant as I did then. The answer is yes.</li>
                  <li>The first behavioral finance writer, before that was a term. The absolute best book ever about the financial markets.</li>
                  <li>This is a delightful introduction to the way the game is played and the many strange motives that people bring to it. Every current or prospective investor should read it.</li>
                  <li>New books on investing haven't had the chance to stand the test of time. <em>The Money Game</em> has, and it does....</li>
                  <li>One of the best books around for the individual investor. Clever, witty, and understandable. Should be on every investor's bookshelf.</li>
                  <li>This book doesn't hold up to time.</li>
                  <li>Not very interesting for traders/investors of 2012, unless you like war stories</li>
                  <li>Fantastic writing&mdash; a little dated but delicious reading. Helps you realize how little has changed.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Fabulous! This was written almost 50 years ago and it is so relevant</li>
                  <li>This important little book was used as our textbook collection while I was getting my Masters in Special Ed. at South Texas State. It was and is an essential book for any parent...</li>
                  <li>What a treasure this book is. It never goes out of style. Mutual respect is at the core.</li>
                  <li>The content is okay but the situations and language are very old-fashioned. I would recommend looking for something more recent.</li>
                  <li>This book is extremely outdated. I didn't realize it was so old when I ordered it. If you'd like advice on how to be a good 1950's housewife to a misogynist, then this is the book for you.</li>
                  <li>I really wanted to like this book. It was recommended in a blog and I was impressed by the reviews here. But I cannot even get through it!</li>
                  <li>Some reasonable suggestions for handling kids, but alot of it is quite dated, particularly the advice on gender roles.</li>

                <h6>Reader reviews from Amazon:</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>A must-read book for any traveler to Spain! Michener is engaging and entertaining while writing about the folklore/history/backstory to many Spanish cities. </li>
                   <li>If you are traveling in Spain, this is a must read. James Michener wrote this about his travels over the years throughout Spain. He talks about the people, the history, the culture, the art, the architecture...everything you could want. This would be a good start for someone who wanted to see a different side of Spain, away from the typical tourist areas.</li>
                   <li>Epic portrait thoroughly researched and a must read for those visiting Spain.</li>
                   <li>You definitely get a insightful cultural perspective from Michener, even though some things may be a bit dated. His love for the place is obvious.</li>
                   <li>Wonderfully written, with insights into Spain and its culture that only an artist with great affection for his subject could bring.</li>
                   <li>I'm in Spain reading this. It's a must backgrounder and delightful deep dive into Spain. Can't keep my eyes off it.</li>
                   <li>I read for enjoyment only and find this book to be very tedious going. It almost seems like a chore. I won't order another Michener in the near future.</li>
                   <li>I prefer his other books in novel form. This was more like a travel guide. He obviously loved Spain, and it encourages me to go there. Still, it was not what I expected. <em>The Source</em> and <em>Hawaii</em> were incredible.</li>
                   <li>Love other James Michener books. This one put me to sleep.</li>
                   <li>I kept hoping it would finally take off but after the twentieth description of some piece of art inside a museum I gave up. I find it sad to abandon a book but just couldn't go on. It may be a good book for some people but a total disappointment if you are expecting anything like <em>Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, Texas,</em> etc.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>No joke..this book changed my life. Desmond Morris compares humans living in cities to animals caged in zoos..laugh now... but he proves it. Probably the best book of all time.</li>
                  <li>Wonderful explanation of our species, but from a zoologist's point of view. As a zoologist myself, I was quite impressed. In many ways his explanations for our behavior make more sense than a psychologist's.</li>
                  <li>Some of his examples now seem a little dated in the age of smartphones and the internet of things, but the essence of what he says still holds true (and will hold true for millenia)....I first read this book back in the 1960s, and I still rank it as one of the 10 most important books that I ever read.</li>
                  <li>Desmond Morris wrote this book in 1967 and it is as relevant today as it was then. We are treated to a fascinating, revealing, serious study of human ecology interlaced with humor and insight that only a first rate, dedicated zoologist could provide. </li>
                  <li>One of the best books I have ever read. Very serious, well structured, well thought and well written. The logic and the theories behind the evidences are superbly deployed and sound.</li>
                  <li>If you are interested in a 1950-60's view of human evolutionary science, this book may be worthwhile. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Evolutionary science has advanced dramatically in the last 50 years.</li>
                  <li>A friend had recommended it as a great read, but I found it dated and boring. General pop science w no stimulating insights. Of course, just my opinion...</li>
                  <li>I have to say&mdash;this book makes you think. It makes you think about society, about the human race and about what you yourself do to get by. And the book is still or even more relevant to this day. Highly recommended.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>A trip through society's "elite" which is interesting to say the least.</li>
                  <li>Enjoyed it but the book dragged a bit.</li>
                  <li>There was very little real substance. I found myself regretting the purchase. Other books by this author were much better.</li>
                  <li>It was fun and interesting, and I'm glad I'm not one of them!</li>
                  <li>This became a little tedious.</li>
                  <li>This book is a must read for people who are interested in the society as it developed in the Gilded Age and forward. Mr Birmingham spins a marvelous work of inter-related topics so well!!</li>
                  <li>Stephen Birmingham is a master of research and has done it again. He gets into the facts and emotions surrounding his subjects. If you enjoy the social settings of a time and place that is often overlooked in American history, this is your book....</li>
                  <li>Old news. Although the "publication date" claims 2015 the book seems stuck in the 1960's. A little more research shows the book was first published in 1958.</li>
                  <li>It should be noted that this book was first published in 1958....any reader looking for dirt or information related to "Society" in its current iteration is likely to be disappointed.</li>
