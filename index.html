          <p class="bio"><strong>THE READING HABITS</strong> of one generation are usually of little interest to another. But 2018 may be different because it marks the fiftieth anniversary of 1968, the year of the late 1960s often seen as a demarcation between the old and new, between the mindset of the 1950s and a newer culture pointedly different from the one before. Many cities have exhibits that highlight a society in the midst of change. In New York City, Carnegie Hall's "The '60s: The Years that Changed America" festival presents programs in conjunction with other cultural institutions that examine the upheaval of those years.</p>
          <p class="bio">"Bestsellers of the late 1960s" opens a window on those times by presenting the bestselling books during those years. What were people reading? What about? Are there signs of a shifting culture? Some of those questions are answered by including readers' reviews from Amazon.com. Have the bestselling titles of those years had staying power? Are the books and authors known today? What does a younger generation think? Amazon.com's readers have some thoughts on those questions, too.</p>

                    <li>A story of the airport manager and many things that happened there. This is a old book but still worth reading if you are at all interested in airports. I liked it . Well written.</li>
                    <li>This book is amazing. I loved it. Kudos to Mr.Arthur Hailey.</li>
                    <li>I will look for more books by him. I retired from being a flight attendant 2 and a half years ago. This was informative as well as entertaining and spell binding. I just can't praise it enough.</li>
                    <li>Great book, a bit dated at this point but still very entertaining!</li>
                    <li>You will not put it down.</li>
                    <li>Engaging from start to finish. Good read.</li>
                    <li>Out of date but still good characters and storyline.</li>
                    <li>The exciting parts were very good, enjoyed the book, but it was WAY too wordy.</li>
                    <li>Pretty boring——it went on and on about the airport policies, etc. I skipped through most of the pages and tried to find the story behind it. It finally did get a little more interesting toward the end.</li>
                    <li>An okay book but it seemed to be an "old book".</li>

                <p class="bio">John Updike's fifth novel, <em>Couples,</em> was his first commercial success, and it remains his best selling title. It was controversial because of the frank descriptions of sex and the sexual interactions among the ten couples who were the subject of the author's fictional scrutiny.</p>  
                  <h6>Reader reviews from Amazon:</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Together with Gore Vidal’s <em>Myra Breckinridge</em> and Phillip Roth’s <em>Portnoy’s Complaint,</em> <em>Couples</em> made 1968 a landmark year in breaking traditional boundaries on how sexual behavior is discussed in mainstream American letters. </li>
                  <li>I am reading COUPLES for the 2nd time. The first time was thirty-some years ago. It holds up.</li>
                  <li>Great story. Mystery, intrigue, suspense.</li>
                  <li>It was a good book 40 years ago. Now it's out of date. There are better books out there now.</li>
                  <li>Typical Updike. Simply great.</li>
                  <li>These days the idea of the suburban life only hiding a miserable bored existence fraught with infidelities is nearly a cliche but Updike's prose and viewpoint still elevate it. You may not like his characters but you'll feel like you know them, for better or for ill.</li>
                   <li>Brilliant brilliant book which sums up a certain time of the American century, you won't forget this one.</li>
                   <li>Like most great literature, the subject is timeless, and deserves the attention of a new reading generation, as well as a re-read from those readers who remember when it was considered shocking and edgy. It still is. </li>
                   <li>My favorite book. I read it every summer. He was a genius.</li>
                  <li>Sloooooow.... story line is dull. This is the story of people swinging in a different time period.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>What a joy to discover Helen MacInnes! Although this book was written in 1968 it is as fresh and current as the most recent spy novels I've read.... Totally engrossing and I recommend it highly to aficionados of spy intrigues...</li>
                  <li>Suspenseful and interesting journey back in time ...</li>
                  <li>Great story. Mystery, intrigue, suspense.</li>
                  <li>Still a terrific read even after all these years. MacInnes was a fantastic story teller with great character development and loads of plot twists.</li>
                  <li>No one writes suspense like Helen MacInnes. This is one of the best.</li>
                  <li><em>The Salzburg Connection</em> is one of MacInnes best. It is post WW II but those Nazis are still active and causing trouble in Europe.</li>
                  <li>I'm really happy I started reading her....I like her and am going to read more.</li>
                  <li>This 1968 novel holds up well in a world of Jack Bauer, fx's The Americans, and Homeland. I couldn't wait to see what happened next.</li>
                  <li>Liked the scenic descriptions. Had to smile at some of the old technology.</li>
                  <li>Decent story line. Too many characters....</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>I am revisiting John Le Carr&eacute; bit by bit. I had not read this one, and took a chance. And what did I find? A diamond.</li>
                  <li>A good read of a difficult time in British and German relations.</li>
                  <li>An early Le Carr&eacute; novel that sets the table for the great ones to follow. A terrific psychological cold war thriller that uncannily anticipates Brexit. Highly recommended.</li>
                  <li>Topical even now with Brexit.</li>
                  <li>This book is so timely, and Le Carr&eacute; is such a brilliant writer. His use of language blows me away. His cynicism is brutal.</li>
                  <li>Converting my library to e-books. Loved this one.</li>
                  <li>Le Carr&eacute;'s sarcastic language is just marvellous. even though the story takes place in Bonn in the end of the 1960s, the description of society and political turmoil is very modern. Enjoy the book.</li>
                  <li>Not his best novel. A muddled mess.</li>

                  <li>Such a great book! It not only has a deep story line about the doctors who are the main characters, but it is also informative about medicine at the turn of the century. I had trouble putting it down! Another great Caldwell book.</li>
                  <li>Wonderful read! Rich in characterization,and plot development.Caldwell uses the storyline to frame many of her social views.Will be reading many more of her books. A great discovery!!</li>
                  <li>As usual, Taylor Caldwell has written another superb novel. They just don't make writers of this caliber anymore. She had such insight into the heart and mind of man...</li>
                  <li>I have never been so tired of reading in my life. So many words, adjectives, were used to write this book. I was not at all impressed. I do think, however, if it was on a screen and could be watched, rather than having to struggle through all the verbiage, adjectives, descriptions, and was just there to see, that it would make a very good mini-series. But, definitely not for reading</li>
                  <li>Excellent book. Takes a bit longer to read since it's written in an older generations style but well worth the time and stretches your vocabulary. Lots of food for thought contained in this book.</li>
                  <li>I enjoy Caldwell 's rich vocabulary and plot twists. Her insights into human behavior always seem to hit the mark.</li>
                  <li>Really slow developing story, bored me to tears. Put it down after 100 pages.</li>
                  <li>Books are not written this well any more. I read it every few years for inspiration</li>
                  <li>One of the finest books I've ever read.</li>
                  <li>Taylor Caldwell always worth reading, she is such a good writer.</li>
